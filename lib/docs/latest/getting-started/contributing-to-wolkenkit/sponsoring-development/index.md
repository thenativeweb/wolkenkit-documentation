# Sponsoring development

If you are a company that would like to contribute to the development of wolkenkit, or if you need specific features, there is the possibility for sponsored development. This way you can help us to improve our development speed, and influence the way features are developed.

Sponsored development is available in different flavours. One option is to pay us to work on features you need. Another option is to provide one or more developers of yours, to work with us on a feature. Also a mixture of both options is possible.

However, sponsored development is reasonable if there are things on the [roadmap](https://github.com/thenativeweb/wolkenkit/blob/master/roadmap.md) of wolkenkit that you would like to have sooner rather than later. Not that you get us wrong – those features are planned anyway, it’s just that you could help us to build them faster.

If you are interested in this, please [contact us](mailto:hello@thenativeweb.io), to discuss the feature in question, its scope, and our estimation for it. The same, of course, applies if you or your team want to help us by submitting code.
