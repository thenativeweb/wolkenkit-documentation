# Submitting a contribution

When you would like to work on a contribution, you may ask yourself what the process of submitting a contribution looks like. In the following we describe the steps you will typically follow.

## Writing an issue

When you have a concrete idea for a contribution to wolkenkit, the first thing to do should be to check whether there is already an [open issue](https://github.com/thenativeweb/wolkenkit/issues) that deals with your idea. If so, you can use this issue as the foundation for your work.

Otherwise, [create an issue](https://github.com/thenativeweb/wolkenkit/issues/new) by using one of the templates and explain in detail what you intend to do and how you plan to do it. This issue serves as a place to discuss your idea and to develop a sustainable concept for its implementation.

The procedure helps to avoid unnecessary work and prevents you from putting work into a solution that turns out to be unsustainable and then requires reworking. Also, when submitting a pull request later on, it is good to have an issue you can refer to in order to provide some context for your pull request.

## Forking the repositories

Once the direction for the issue is set, fork the necessary repositories. This allows you to commit and push without any restrictions, as your forks are under your control. This way we do not need a special setup procedure for every contributor.

## Commiting your changes

As said before, commit and push any work you do to your forked repositories. While working on them, you may need to [synchronize your forks with the upstream repositories](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) and resolve conflicts from time to time. In general, it is advisable to keep work on a fork short in order to avoid conflicts as much as possible.

## Submitting a pull request

Before submitting a pull request, please make sure to [synchronize your forks with the upstream `master` branches of the repositories](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/), and resolve any conflicts that may appear. Then create a pull request and link it to the appropriate issue.

You may also want to write a few comments on what your pull request does, which makes it easier to review the pull request as one then knows what to expect.

Please keep pull requests small and focused on one thing. If you want to contribute multiple things, use separate pull requests, as they can be individually reviewed, discussed and merged. The more a pull request contains, the harder this gets.

## Signing the CLA

If the pull request you submit is your first pull request for a repository, you will be asked to sign our [contributor license agreement (CLA)](https://gist.github.com/goloroden/71fedc0689d1c65a56aef5a5d3415fdd). Please understand that for legal reasons we will not merge pull requests from authors who reject to sign the CLA.
