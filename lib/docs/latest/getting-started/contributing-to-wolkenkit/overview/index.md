# Overview

wolkenkit is an open-source CQRS and event-sourcing framework for JavaScript and Node.js developed by [the native web](https://www.thenativeweb.io/).

To build a vibrant open-source community we have licensed wolkenkit using GNU Affero General Public License, Version 3 (AGPLv3) published by the Free Software Foundation. To also create a sustainable business that reliably backs the open-source model we additionally offer wolkenkit using a proprietary license. For us, open-source and business are not contradictory, but rather form a respectful partnership to create better software.

We value your dedication to improve wolkenkit. Every contribution is important, from code to documentation, from asking questions to providing answers. For ideas on what to contribute, please have a look at [developing ideas for contributions](../devloping-ideas-for-contributions/). Additionally, before you start working on a contribution, please read [submitting a contribution](../submitting-a-contribution/).

If you have any questions or are not sure how to proceed, please note that you can always [get help](../../understanding-wolkenkit/getting-help/).
