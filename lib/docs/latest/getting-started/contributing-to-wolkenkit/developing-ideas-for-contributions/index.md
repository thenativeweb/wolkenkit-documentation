# Developing ideas for contributions

If you would like to contribute to wolkenkit, you may already have a specific idea â€“ or none at all. Just like there are no stupid questions there are also no worthless contributions. We strongly believe that every contribution is important, from code to documentation, from asking questions to providing answers.

In the following we describe different aspects how you can contribute to wolkenkit. Before you start working on an issue, please read [submitting a contribution](../submitting-a-contribution/).

## Contributing code

The most obvious way to add value to wolkenkit is by contributing code. This includes fixing bugs, extending existing features, and even implementing new features. In the [thenativeweb/wolkenkit](https://github.com/thenativeweb/wolkenkit/issues) repository you can find a list of all currently open issues. Additionally, to get a high-level overview of what is planned for wolkenkit, have a look at the [roadmap](https://github.com/thenativeweb/wolkenkit/blob/master/roadmap.md).

Typical questions to come up with ideas are:

- What feature does not work as expected?
- What feature could be extended in its functionality?
- What feature are you missing completely?

## Reporting issues and raising ideas

If you found a bug or have an idea for a new feature, [report an issue](https://github.com/thenativeweb/wolkenkit/issues/new) for it. To prevent the identical issue being reported multiple times, you should verify whether there is already an issue for your concern in the list of [open issues](https://github.com/thenativeweb/wolkenkit/issues).

Typical questions to come up with ideas are:

- What feature does not work as expected?
- What feature could be extended in its functionality?
- What feature are you missing completely?

## Improving the documentation

A helpful contribution can be to correct a typo or to improve and enhance an explanation that is too vague. For this purpose, each page of the documentation contains a link at the bottom, which you can use to directly [edit the page](https://github.com/thenativeweb/wolkenkit-documentation/edit/master/lib/docs/<%= current.version %>/getting-started/contributing-to-wolkenkit/getting-ideas-for-contributions/index.md) on GitHub.

Typical questions to come up with ideas are:

- What part of the documentation is not described with sufficient detail?
- What part of the documentation could use an image to make things more clear?
- What part of the documentation is there, but hard to find?

## Developing a sample application

[Sample applications](../../../media/sample-applications/wolkenkit-boards/) help others interested in wolkenkit to get a better understanding of how things work. Whether you want to develop a new sample application or enhance an existing one, we would love to know what you are building with wolkenkit.

Typical questions to come up with ideas are:

- What application have you ever wanted to build?
- What application would you like to rebuild for learning purposes?
- What application could be needed by your family or friends?

If you have something to share, we would love to hear from you, so please feel free to [contact us](mailto:hello@thenativeweb.io).

## Spreading the word

Are you writing a [blog](../../../media/online-resources/blog-posts/), or [articles](../../../media/online-resources/articles/) for an IT magazine? Do you use Twitter or other social media regularly? Are you giving [talks](../../../media/online-resources/videos/) at meetups or conferences? If any of this applies to you, you can contribute to wolkenkit by spreading the word.

Typical questions to come up with ideas are:

- What story could be interesting to tell about wolkenkit?
- What have been your experiences with using wolkenkit?
- What have you learned from using wolkenkit?

If you would like to write, but don't have your own blog, we can also talk about a guest post for the [blog by the native web](https://www.thenativeweb.io/blog). Additionally, we would be happy to link to your content, such as videos of your talks. Either way, feel free to [contact us](mailto:hello@thenativeweb.io).
