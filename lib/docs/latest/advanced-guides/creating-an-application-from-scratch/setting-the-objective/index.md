# Setting the objective

In this guide you will create an application from scratch. The objective is to introduce you to wolkenkit, its structure and mindset, so that you get a first impression of what software development with wolkenkit looks like.

## Defining the application

Your application will be a chat that allows sending and receiving messages in order to talk to other users. Additionally, users are able to like messages. In contrast to [creating your first application](../../../getting-started/creating-your-first-application/setting-the-objective/), you will now create the entire application from scratch by yourself.

## Defining the features

For this, you will implement the following features:

- Users can send messages.
- Users can like messages.
- Sent messages are visible to all users.
- When a user enters the chat they are shown the previously sent messages.
- When a user receives a message the UI is updated in real-time.
- Sending and receiving messages is possible using an API.
- Sending and receiving messages is encrypted.

## Limiting the scope

To avoid that developing your first application goes beyond the scope of this guide, there are a few constraints that limit its scope:

- There are no chat rooms.
- There are no private messages.
- There is no authentication.
- There is no authorization.

Now, let's get started and do some [modeling with your team](../modeling-with-your-team/)!
