# Handling events

To handle an event, add the fully-qualified name of the event to the `when` object and provide a function to handle the event. Like commands, this function takes two parameters, the list itself and the event.

Inside of the function, add code that updates the list according to the event.

E.g., to handle the `issued` event of an invoice, use the following code:

```javascript
const when = {
  'accounting.invoice.issued' (invoices, event) {
    // ...
  }
};
```

Some event handlers require asynchronous code. Therefore, you can use the keywords `async` and `await`. To be able do this, define the handler using the `async` keyword:

```javascript
const when = {
  async 'accounting.invoice.issued' (invoices, event) {
    // ...
  }
};
```

## Adding items

To add an item to a list, call the list's `add` function and provide the item you want to add. You have access to all of the event's data, including its metadata such as the id of the aggregate the event refers to. If you do not provide an `id` explicitly, wolkenkit will automatically use the id of the aggregate the event refers to.

E.g., to add an invoice to the list of invoices once an `issued` event is received, use the following code:

```javascript
const when = {
  'accounting.invoice.issued' (invoices, event) {
    invoices.add({
      amount: event.data.amount,
      participant: event.data.participant
    });
  }
};
```

## Updating items

To update an item, call the list's `update` function and provide a `where` clause as well as an update expression. Use the `where` clause to specify which items to update, and the update expression to specify how these items will be updated.

E.g., to update an invoice once a `sentAsLetterPost` event is received, use the following code:

```javascript
const when = {
  'accounting.invoice.sentAsLetterPost' (invoices, event) {
    invoices.update({
      where: { id: event.aggregate.id },
      set: {
        sentAsLetterPost: true
      }
    });
  }
};
```

## Removing items

Finally, to remove an item, call the list's `remove` function and provide a `where` clause to describe one or more items to be removed.

E.g., to remove an invoice from the list of invoices once a `paid` event is received, use the following code:

```javascript
const when = {
  'accounting.invoice.paid' (invoices, event) {
    invoices.remove({
      where: { id: event.aggregate.id }
    });
  }
};
```
