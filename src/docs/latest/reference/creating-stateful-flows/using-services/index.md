# Using services

To use services, add `services` as third parameter to your reaction.

E.g., if you want to use services when a flow transitions from the `pristine` state to the `awaiting-payment` state, use the following code:

```javascript
const when = {
  pristine: {
    'awaiting-payment' (flow, event, services) {
      // ...
    }
  }  
};
```

Since you do not usually need all services at the same time, it will make sense to request only the services you need. To do this, use destructuring to specify the services you need, e.g.:

```javascript
const when = {
  pristine: {
    'awaiting-payment' (flow, event, { app }) {
      // ...
    }
  }  
};
```

## Sending commands

Sometimes you may need to send commands to the application from a reaction. For that use the `app` service, access the context and the aggregate, and call the command function.

E.g., if you want to send an `awaitPayment` command to the invoice that caused a transition from the `pristine` state to the `awaiting-payment` state, use the following code:

```javascript
const when = {
  pristine: {
    'awaiting-payment' (flow, event, { app }) {
      app.accounting.invoice(event.aggregate.id).awaitPayment();
    }
  }  
};
```

## Writing log output

To write JSON-formatted log output use the `logger` service. Internally this service uses [flaschenpost](https://github.com/thenativeweb/flaschenpost). For details on how to use flaschenpost see its [documentation](https://github.com/thenativeweb/flaschenpost).

E.g., to log messages when a flow transitions from the `pristine` state to the `awaiting-payment` state, use the following code:

```javascript
const when = {
  pristine: {
    'awaiting-payment' (flow, event, { logger }) {
      logger.info('Transitioning from pristine to awaiting payment...');
      // ...
    }
  }  
};
```
